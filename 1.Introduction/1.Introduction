NumPy : (Numerical Python)

- It uses for scientific computing.
- It provides support for large multi-dimentional arrays and matrices 
along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on arrays.

- In its core , it uses ndarray(n-dimentional array) object which allows
us to store and manipulate large datasets in a memory-efficient manner.
Unlike python's built in lists, NumPy are homogeneous and enable faster 
operations.

# KEY-FEATURES
- N-Dimentional arrays :
  Numpy's core feature is ndarray, a powerful N-DIMENATIONAL Array object
  that supports homogeneous data types.

- Arrays with High Performance:
  Arrays are stored in contigious memory locations, enabling faster computations
  than Python lists.

- Broadcasting :
  Allows element-wise computations betn arrays of different shapes.
  It simplifies operations on arrays of various shapes by automatically
  aligning their dimentions without creating new data.

- Vectorization:
  Eliminates the need of explicit Python loops by applying
  operations directly on entire arrays.

- Linear Algebra:
  Numpy contains routines for linear algebra operations,such as matrix 
  multiplication,decompostions and deteminants.

# IMPORTANT FACTS
- Vectorized operations : Numpy operations are faster than python lists
because they use optimized C-based functions.
- Broadcasting Feature : Numpy allows operations betn arrays of different
shapes without expilict looping known as Broadcasting, making it easier
to handle large datasets.

# Its uses :
- Creating and manipulating arrays
- Performing element-wise and matrix operations
- Generating random numbers and statistical calculations.
- Conducting linear algebra operations.
- Working with Fourier transformations. (signals frequency related)
- Handling missing values efficiently in datasets.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHY LEARN NUMPY?
- It speed up mathematical operations like addition and multiplication 
on large group of numbers compared to regular python.
- Its good for handling large lists of numbers ( arrays ) , so no need
to use loops.
- It gives us ready-to-use functions for statistics, algebra and 
random numbers.
- Libraries like Pandas,SciPy,TensorFlow and many others are built on
top fo numpy.
- It uses less memory and stores data more effeciently, which matters 
when working with lots of data.
